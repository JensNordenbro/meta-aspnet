I. Adding the aspnet layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the aspnet layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the aspnet layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-mono \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-aspnet \
    "


II. Misc
========

The current 4.2 versions of Mono (as of 2015-12-16) don't work with ASP.NET 5.
I have sucessfully tested `PREFERRED_VERSION_mono[-native]="4.0.4.1"` on an ARM platform,
when the patches in this layer (especially the IL_0057 one) are applied.
